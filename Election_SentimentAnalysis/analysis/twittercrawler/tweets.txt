You'll keep on counting what Modi Gov has done for the nation and for its people, what others couldn't do in last 60 years of Gov, coz they ruled the nation and Mr. Modi Served his nation, thats the difference.

Rap Song by @BJP4India
The gang of has no vision for India; it only wants to unseat @narendramodi and grab power. These opportunists will destroy my India. This makes me more committed to support .
@TajinderBagga @narendramodi Kind of speedy extradition of criminals and Scams linked to politicians getting opned, I think in few months all will be in Tihar/Arther road jail and none left for PM position fight
@TajinderBagga @narendramodi I will vote for bcoz he delivered what he said. Money and help now reaches the needy. 100 Paisa out of 1 rupee now reaches to one who deserves.
4 news portals; all with the same story Basically media is trying its best to find another kejriwal (2014) in 2019 to fight against Narendra Modi. People of India must be very careful with this kind of propaganda.
Ultimate on
From making international headlines for scams and corruption allegations for a decade, to now being known for anti-corruption measures and transparent governance. This is the change PM Modi ensured for India
In 2019 Me and my entire family of 8 will vote .Bcoz He is Honest with Great integrity.Sincerely trying to make Hindusthan a better Desh. He is booking all corrupt &amp; Chor. All the schemes he has launched is "Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas"
Modi govt's efforts in last 4 years in governance reforms have been to institutionalise honesty in a way that every system and institution is designed to inculcate as well as inspire honesty.

BJP govt stands for the aspirations of common people, for the poor, for the oppressed &amp; for the needy. It's Modi govt that is giving the Annadaatas of the country a new hope &amp; future. BJP govt is heralding a vision of New India driven by its people
BJP is the party that is taking farmers out of miseries, bringing dignity to every woman, bringing happiness in every household &amp; putting smiles on millions of faces. Let's vote for development. Let's vote for BJP.

@narendramodi It is very unfortunate but still it is not so simple to take out this beautiful Chorus during upcoming elections. At the same time please make sure each and every chorus should convert to vote. Good luck
All those who think will be similar to need to wake up. At a national level the fact remains that they're is only one candidate @narendramodi. These same states will vote differently if we were choosing our PM
People want relief from 'autocratic' ; in polls, will defeat it in :
Demonetization hurt more than it benefited the economy, several veterans have said so far. However, many believe the move helped BJP in UP elections. After today's it's around four months to polls and I'm slightly anxious on what's to come.
RT @Gitanjali_DS: @republic I would not put it past d to say that intentionally did not hack d in d 3 states‚Ä¶
@BJP4India needs to realise that even though may have the largest seat share in the , the voters in UP are not the voters across the nation (including the Hindi heartland). 'Bhagwa Baazi' could be toned down for a more welfare based public image.
Its unlikely that BJP will lose the upcoming election but I can surely see its performance decreasing.
Lose of BJP in three states of only Becoz of internal matters of state. Ppl don't want BJP as ruling party in state but it is inappropriate to predict same result for elections.
In 2004 @BJP4India won 3 out of 4 but lost the elections So will @INCIndia see the same fate in Like they say about voter U never know what's in their mind
@republic I would not put it past d to say that intentionally did not hack d in d 3 states of , and so as not to raise any questions of manipulation in the 2019 elections!
Happy with the election results. That's the beauty of democracy. is vital for democracy. election is entirely different than regional elections. Hope will learn and win needs for atleast 1 more term.
A big takeaway from 2018 is that if has such big losses in three Hindi-heartland then, it might suffer the similar loss in the . On the other hand, With the big battle of 2019 approaching ,
@drramansingh @amaragrawalBJP I hoped u know powers of u totally ignored Then losses most of seats in chhattisgarh be careful for Don't ignored thats only trailers...

failed to clean all the garbage. However, atleast he managed to accumulate it in one place called . Now it's our job at to clean it !!!
Yes there are problems. Governing a country as heterogenous and vast as India which has been reeling under problems since centuries is never a joke. Now ask yourself - who can and who has the capability to solve your problems ?
Check macro and micro-economic parameters. Compare infrastructure growth. Compare core areas. Compare GDP growth. Compare wholesale and consumer inflation. Every single parameter is much healthier than before.
‚û§ He may not make India like Europe or US in his lifetime however hard he tries. But atleast he is governing much better than previous regimes.
‚û§ He is working hard. He has no family or no one after him. Anyone of u who keep abusing him, Are u even a fraction of him in dedication, focus, integrity? He is cleaner than all others. He is not corrupt. He is a visionary. He has solutions to many.

‚û§ Because he has pushed forward many reforms which are not going down well with people today, but will unleash a new India when the results of those reforms - structural, economic, infrastructural will be visible in next 8-10 years.
‚û§ Because I have seen him taking unpopular steps just to make sure subsidies and taxes reach to the poor people and not middlemen.
‚û§ Because I have seen that massive corruption at cabinet ministerial level has disappeared. ‚û§ Because I have seen that India has not witnessed any terror attack on civilians in last 4 years under his rule.
For all the people who say Ram is a myth...
‚û§ Because I do believe he is giving his best to improve the country in all areas.
‚û§ Because I do believe he is doing whatever he can in a very honest, dedicated and committed way.

The @BJP4India &amp; several of its alliance partners from have locked in a political fray ahead of PM @narendramodi Modi &amp; @AmitShah have to carefully grapple with the situation so as to ensure 2019 win.
16. Increased tax compliance post demonetization 17.MUDRA scheme for small entrepreneurs 18. Setting up additional IIT and AIIMS These alone are tremendous to bring back @narendramodi @BJP4India i will continue with pain points ..
13. Health coverage for all Indians under Ayushman Bharat 14. campaign invigorating manufacturing sector 15. UDAN scheme reviving aviation sector and making flying affordable to most middle class travelers
10. Modernizing railways (new coaches, vistadome, ghatiman, train18, talgo) and more than doubled track replacement 11. Bank accounts for millions of Indians for first time 12. Direct Benefits transfer eliminated pilferage
7. Coal sector reforms which reduced the need for coal imports 8. Highway infrastructure (more than doubled the rate to 24 km/day) 9. Inland waterways opened up for freight and for tourism
4. Eliminating Diesel &amp; Gas subsidy 5. GST 6. Power Sector reform with UDAY scheme nurturing electricity boards under huge debt and increased plant utility factor and power availability.
1. REIT&amp;INVIT (partly relieves stress on banks with twin balance sheet and enable vital real estate and infrastructure to grow) 2. Bankruptcy code to speed up the process 3. Assets review and making banks report real NPA
Case to give @narendramodi one more time . While there is tighter money supply in india and some growing pains some of the reforms are starting to take hold .. some significant but tough reforms

If was successful your government should bring direct taxes down. Say 15 % for 10 lacs and above but upto 1 cr bracket. And GST is anyway taking care of revenue. This will send the right signal.

In a remarkable achievement, Modi govt has made goods &amp; services affordable for middle class by curbing inflation &amp; bringing it down to an average of 4.7% in 2014-18 from 9.8% in 2010-14. This has eased lives.
Modi Govt understands inflation is a hidden tax which hits the middle class hard. From double digit food inflation days of UPA, Modi Govt has brought it down drastically. Daily living is easier.
With lower taxes &amp; affordable living, Modi govt's GST reform has made ease of living a reality for middle class of country. Most items which used to be taxed very high are taxed at 18% or below.
